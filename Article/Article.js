    secondParagraph: `His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn't help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found it.`,

    thirdParagraph: `There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.`

    secondParagraph: `It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers.`,

    thirdParagraph: `It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next`

    firstParagraph: `Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, but that's not for me to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?`,

    secondParagraph: `A long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five Venusians, very much startled, looked overhead. They were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information "Pepsi-Cola."`,

    thirdParagraph: `I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.`

/* Step 1: Create a function that creates a component. You will want your component to look like the template below: 
  
  <div class="article">
    <h2>{title of the article}</h2>
    <p class="date">{date of the article}</p>

    {three separate paragraph elements}

    <span class='expandButton'></span>
  </div>

  Hint: You will need to use createElement more than once here!

  Your function should take either an object as it's one argument, or 5 separate arguments mapping to each piece of the data object above.

  Step 2: Add an event listener to the expandButton span. This event listener should toggle the class 'article-open' on the 'article' div.

  Step 3: return the entire component.

  Step 4: Map over the data, creating a component for each oject and add each component to the DOM as children of the 'articles' div.

  Step 5: Add a new article to the array. Make sure it is in the same format as the others. Refresh the page to see the new article.
